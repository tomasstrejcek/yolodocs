## Cross-Phase Integration

| From | To | Status | Issue |
|------|-----|--------|-------|
| loader.ts (DocsPage.title) | build.ts (manifest item.name) | ✓ Wired | — |
| build.ts (3-level hierarchy) | Sidebar.tsx (renders children) | ✓ Wired | — |
| build.ts (.html anchors) | app.config.ts (autoSubfolderIndex) | ✓ Wired | — |
| build.ts (.html anchors) | Sidebar.tsx (active state .html strip) | ✓ Wired | — |
| build.ts (.html anchors) | [...path].tsx (slug .html strip) | ✓ Wired | — |
| build.ts (.html anchors) | WelcomePage.tsx (.html href) | ✓ Wired | — |
| build.ts (group children) | SearchDialog.tsx (search index) | ⚠ Partial | Children not indexed |

---

## E2E Flow Verification

| Flow | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Build pipeline: loader → manifest → JSON | ✓ Complete | Title priority chain and 3-level hierarchy flow correctly |
| Flat HTML prerender | ✓ Complete | autoSubfolderIndex + .html anchors aligned |
| Direct URL navigation on static host | ✓ Complete | .html stripping in route + sidebar works |
| Sidebar 3-level rendering | ✓ Complete | Sections, groups, children all render |
| Search for nested doc page | ⚠ Broken | SearchDialog does not recurse into group children |

---

## Tech Debt

| Phase | Item |
|-------|------|
| 02 (surfaced by Phase 1 structure) | SearchDialog does not flatten group children into search index — nested pages unreachable via search |

---

## Summary

Phases 1 and 2 are fully verified with all 12 assigned requirements satisfied. Phase 3 remains unexecuted, leaving 7 navigation and title requirements unsatisfied. One minor integration gap exists where SearchDialog does not index 3-level group children (can be addressed in Phase 3).

**To complete milestone v1.0:** Execute Phase 3 (Sidebar and Page Rendering), which addresses all 7 remaining requirements plus the SearchDialog gap.
