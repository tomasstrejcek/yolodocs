# v1.0 Milestone Audit Report

**Milestone:** Yolodocs Documentation UX Improvements v1.0
**Audited:** 2026-02-20T15:45:00Z
**Status:** PASSED
**Definition of Done:** Documentation pages must be navigable, correctly titled, and work when opened in new tabs on any static hosting.

## Phase Summary

| Phase | Goal | Verification Status | Requirements |
|-------|------|---------------------|--------------|
| 1. Data Layer | 3-level navigation manifest with H1-derived titles | passed (9/9 truths) | 8/8 satisfied |
| 2. Flat HTML Output | Flat .html files for static hosting | passed (8/8 truths) | 4/4 satisfied |
| 3. Sidebar and Page Rendering | Recursive sidebar, collapse persistence, H1 suppression, per-page titles | passed (7/7 truths, human verification items noted) | 7/7 satisfied |

All 3 phases verified. No unverified phases.

**Score: 19/19 requirements satisfied**
**Orphaned requirements: 0**

Note: SUMMARY.md files use `provides` and `requirements` fields rather than `requirements_completed`. Cross-reference used these as the secondary source. All 19 requirements are independently confirmed by both VERIFICATION.md status and REQUIREMENTS.md traceability checkbox.

## Cross-Phase Integration

**Integration checker result:** 19/19 requirements WIRED across phases. 0 broken flows.

### E2E Flow Verification

| Flow | Path | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| Schema scan -> manifest -> sidebar render | loader.ts -> build.ts -> manifest.json -> Sidebar.tsx | COMPLETE |
| Direct URL access to flat .html file | Browser -> Nitro flat file -> slug strip -> page lookup -> sidebar active | COMPLETE |
| H1 suppression pipeline | loader.ts extractFirstH1 -> DocsPage.content retains H1 -> MarkdownPage hasH1 -> Show conditional | COMPLETE |
| Browser tab title on navigation | DocsPage.title -> [...path].tsx createEffect -> document.title | COMPLETE |
| Sidebar collapse persistence | localStorage read/write -> SidebarSubGroup mount -> auto-expand createEffect | COMPLETE |
| Search indexes nested pages | manifest.json sections -> flattenNavItems recursion -> allItems -> search match -> navigate | COMPLETE |

### Integration Notes

- SearchDialog `isDoc` detection uses `includes("/docs/")` fallback — works but fragile under non-default base-path deployments. Non-blocking.
- `prerenderRoutes` in `app.config.ts` correctly omits `.html` extension — Nitro applies `.html` naming via `autoSubfolderIndex: false`.
- Phase 3 human verification items (auto-expand, collapse persistence, H1 visual, tab title reactivity) are runtime behaviors confirmed by code inspection but flagged for browser testing.

---

## Tech Debt

| Phase | Item | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| Phase 3 | `SearchResults()` null export stub in SearchDialog.tsx — unused barrel export | Info |
| Phase 3 | SearchDialog `isDoc` detection fragile under non-standard base-path | Minor |

**Total: 2 items across 1 phase** — no blockers.

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Phase 1: None found
- Phase 2: None found
- Phase 3: 1 benign stub (`SearchResults` null export), 1 false-positive (`placeholder` HTML attribute)

---

## Test Suite

All 58 tests pass across 2 test files:
- `src/markdown/loader.test.ts`: 26 tests
- `src/cli/build.test.ts`: 32 tests
